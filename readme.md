# This is the Repository for Alex's MusicTree project.

## MusicTree is a Digital Music Streaming Service that gives users access to songs from artists across the world

### *Musicians and producers often have a hard time getting their music heard. I myself find it hard to get any views on my music and platforms such as youtube or soundcloud are oversaturated. For my Capstone I created an app where a community of musicians can showcase their work and gain more attention.*
