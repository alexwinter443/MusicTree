# This is the Repository for Alex's MusicTree project.

## MusicTree is a Digital Music Streaming Service that gives users access to songs from artists across the world

### *Musicians and producers often have a hard time getting their music heard. I myself find it hard to get any views on my music and platforms such as youtube or soundcloud are oversaturated. For my Capstone I created an app where a community of musicians can showcase their work and gain more attention.*  


# Requirements
## Functional Requirement for MusicTree:

### 1. Users can login and register

### 2. Users can add tracks.

### 3. Users can stream music on phone or pc

### 4. Musicians can edit or delete tracks

### 5. Users can like or comment on tracks

## Non-functional Requirements for MusicTree

### user friendly and modern design

### fast response rate

# BeatsTree is built using C#, ASP.NET, BOOTSTRAP and AZURE

> I wanted to create a functional app before I used React for my front-end. React will be used after I finished the backend environment.

## Object Oriented programming (OOP) and MVC architecture was used to create a balanced environment.

## MusicTree was deployed to Azure but had to be taken down for because it was costing to much.
