# This is the Repository for Alex Vergara's MusicTree project.

## MusicTree is a Digital Music Streaming Service that gives users access to songs from artists across the world

### *Musicians and producers often have a hard time getting their music heard. I myself find it hard to get any views on my music and platforms such as youtube or soundcloud are oversaturated. For my Capstone I wanted to create an app where a community of musicians can showcase their work.*  


# Requirements
## Here are some of the functional requirements I set for MusicTree:

### 1. Users can login and register

### 2. A User can add a track
