# This is the Repository for Alex's MusicTree project.

## MusicTree is a Digital Music Streaming Service that gives users access to songs from artists across the world

### *Musicians and producers often have a hard time getting their music heard. I myself find it hard to get any views on my music and platforms such as youtube or soundcloud are oversaturated. For my Capstone I created an app where a community of musicians can showcase their work and gain more attention.*  


# Requirements
## Functional Requirement for MusicTree:

### 1. Users can login and register

### 2. Users can add tracks.

### 3. Users can stream music on phone or pc

### 4. Musicians can edit or delete tracks

### 5. Users can like or comment on tracks

## Non-functional Requirements for MusicTree

### user friendly and modern design

### fast response rate

# BeatsTree is built using C#, ASP.NET, BOOTSTRAP and AZURE

> I wanted to create a functional app before I used React for my front-end. React will be used after I finished the backend environment.

## Object Oriented programming (OOP) and MVC architecture was used to create a balanced environment.

## MusicTree was deployed to Azure but had to be taken down for because it was costing to much.

### The Front end of Music Tree is built using Custom CSS and Bootstrap.

### The Backend uses C# and the ASP.NET framework.

### MusicTree is hosted on Azure (edit: no longer on azure due to cost)

### •	This is the physical solution design of our application. This depicts the flow of storing and distributing mp3 files for users.
### •	Media source files are delivered using MPEG-DASH. (essentially a streaming protocol that breaks down data into chunks at different quality levels).
### •	Dynamic packaging reduces storage costs and space.
### •	Streaming Endpoint as origin service: Directly delivers content to client player.
### •	Dynamic asset filtering and modification without having to re-encode or re-render content.
### •	Keys and tokens for secure content delivery.

## What I learned

### Gained a complex understanding of the C# programmning language.
### Cloud Development: Dived into cloud development researching different cloud providers and implementing cloud services in app.
### Uploading and streaming music: learned azure
### Project Management: gained experience in managing products under tight time constraints.

## Risks and Challenges

### Cloud Service Costs: need to monitor spending weekly

### Time Constraints: given a semester to develop this application

### User Experience and design: not much time given to use a frontend framework

## Outstanding Issues

### The only issue I came across was cost on azure services. It became to expensive to keep it hosted so I had to take it down.
